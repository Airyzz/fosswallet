# How FossWallet uses your data
FossWallet does not collect any of your personal data.

If you grant FossWallet network access, you may update supported passes via an "update"-button on the pass.
If you enable the automatic pass update setting, FossWallet will regularly check for updates of all updatable passes in the App from the passes' vendor servers.
When performing an update, the app will transmit the pass's identifier and authentication token to the vendor service defined in the Pass itself to get a new version of the pass.
This explicitly opt-in feature is the only way in which FossWallet will ever transmit data off your device.
