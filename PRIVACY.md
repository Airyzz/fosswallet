# How FossWallet uses your data
FossWallet does not collect any of your personal data.
All data stays on your device.

If you grant FossWallet network access, it will regularly check for updates of all updated passes in the App from the passes' vendor servers.
To do so, it will transmit the pass's identifier and authentication token to the vendor service to get a new version of the pass.
