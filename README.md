# FossWallet
FossWallet is a free and open source (foss) .pkpass application.
Inspired by the venerable [PassAndroid](https://github.com/ligi/PassAndroid)-App,
I tried to recreate the necessary functionality in Material Design 3 and with modern
technologies.

## Getting FossWallet
You can download FossWallet from GitHub-Releases, my [personal F-Droid Repo](https://github.com/SeineEloquenz/fdroid) or the official [F-Droid repo](https://f-droid.org/).
GitHub releases and the different F-Droid repos use the same signing keys so you can
easily switch between both sources.
